###### Parent:
    Any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node called parent.

###### Child:
    The node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node.

###### Leaf:
    The node which does not have any child node is called the leaf node.

###### Subtree:
    Subtree represents the descendants of a node.

###### Visiting:
