# C - Binary trees

A binary tree is a data structure which can be represented in the form of a hierarchy of which each element is called node, the initial node being called root.

## Important Terms

###### Path:
    Path refers to the sequence of nodes along the edges of a tree.

###### Root:
    The node at the top of the tree is called root. There is only one root per tree and one path from the root node to any node.

###### Parent:
    Any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node called parent.

###### Child:
    The node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node.

###### Leaf:
    The node which does not have any child node is called the leaf node.

###### Subtree:
    Subtree represents the descendants of a node.

###### Visiting:
    Visiting refers to checking the value of a node when control is on the node.

###### Traversing:
    Traversing means passing through nodes in a specific order.

###### Levels:
    Level of a node represents the generation of a node. If the root node is at level 0, then its next child node is at level 1, its grandchild is at level 2, and so on.

###### keys:
    Key represents a value of a node based on which a search operation is to be carried out for a node.

## Basic Binary Tree

```c
/**
 * struct binary_tree_s - Binary tree node
 *
 * @n: Integer stored in the node
 * @parent: Pointer to the parent node
 * @left: Pointer to the left child node
 * @right: Pointer to the right child node
 */
struct binary_tree_s
{
    int n;
    struct binary_tree_s *parent;
    struct binary_tree_s *left;
    struct binary_tree_s *right;
};

typedef struct binary_tree_s binary_tree_t;
```

## Binary Search Tree

```c
typedef struct binary_tree_s bst_t;
```
